# Introduction

This backend code is built using the Node.js runtime environment, and utilizes the Express.js framework to create a RESTful API for a plant tracker application. It includes routes for creating, updating, and retrieving plant resources stored in a MongoDB database.

# How to run it and install it

1. Install Node.js and MongoDB on your machine, if you haven't already.
2. Clone the repository to your local machine.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.
4. Run `npm install` to install the dependencies listed in the package.json file.
5. Run `npm start` to start the server.
6. Use a web browser or a tool like Postman to send HTTP requests to the server.

# Important notes to first time backend developers

- This code assumes basic knowledge of JavaScript and Node.js. If you are not familiar with these technologies, it is recommended that you start by learning the basics before diving into this code.
- Understanding the basics of RESTful API design is also important when working with this code. A good resource for learning about RESTful API design is the [REST API Tutorial](https://restfulapi.net/).
- This code uses the Express.js framework, which provides a lot of powerful features for building web applications. It is recommended that you read the [Express.js documentation](https://expressjs.com/) to learn about the various features and concepts used in this code.
- This code uses the mongoose library to connect to a MongoDB database and define data models. If you are not familiar with MongoDB or mongoose, it is recommended that you read the [MongoDB documentation](https://docs.mongodb.com/) and the [mongoose documentation](https://mongoosejs.com/docs/) to learn about these technologies.
- It is important to properly handle errors and validate user input when building web applications. This code includes some basic error handling and validation, but it is recommended that you do further research on these topics and implement more robust solutions in your own applications.
